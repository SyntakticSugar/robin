# Robin :bird: 

a proof assistant for the simply typed lambda calculus written in Haskell.

### Inspiration
I have enjoyed learning about proof assistants. After watching this [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jimmGDcTx4Y&t=1s) and reading this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.09473) by Prabhakar Ragde, I was inspired to learn how proof assistants work. 

Following Ragde, I have decided to learn by doing. Robin is my attempt at reverse engineering the architecture of a proof assistant for the simply typed lambda calculus equiv. propositional implicational logic.
